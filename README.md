- 👋 - Hi, I am Milena Ruslanovna Laubakh, I am 21 years old (06.03.2002)
- 👀 - I am interested in learning everything new and unusual, I do programming for myself to keep my brain in good shape, since my basic education has more theoretical knowledge in the field of sports and tourism
- 🌱 - I am currently studying at the 4th year of the University of Sports in Kazan, hiking, and have my own tour club. I work as an administrator in a creative center. I walk a lot, write letters, draw, make large models from different materials.
- 💞 ️ I am looking for opportunities to collaborate with different companies, as an intern. I go to find out the it sphere from the inside, and not as we are told about it
